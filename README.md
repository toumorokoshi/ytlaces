# ytlaces

## prerequisites

- Install [HWE kernels](https://ubuntu.com/kernel/lifecycle). I have encountered issues with older kernels in the past.
- Install Insync
- Install Sunshine
- Install `fcitx5`, and configure the languages by hand with `fcitx5-confgitool`.

## Installing

1. clone this repo
1. install puppet
1. symlink repo to one of the following until it works:
  * `/etc/puppet/code/modules/` (possibly since puppet 4?)
  * `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/ytlaces`
  * `/etc/puppet/code/environments/standalone_puppet/modules`
4. install the following modules:
  *  `puppet module install puppetlabs-vcsrepo`
  *  `puppet module install puppetlabs-apt`
  *  `puppet module install puppet-archive`
4. Run the appropriate `bin/install_{env}`.
* `$ puppet apply examples/init.pp`

## installation into rc and profile

The following files serve the following purposes:

| filename          | purpose                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$HOME/.xprofile` | yt-laces managed, for configuration that applies to all yt machines.         |
| `$HOME/.profile`  | user-managed, for configuration specific to the host.                        |
| `$HOME/.bashrc`   | user-managed, for configuration specific to the host. should source ytlaces. |

* add a section into your bash/zsh rc file that sources in a whole directory of rc files:

  `. $HOME/.ytlaces/init`

## post-install setup.

There's a couple more steps that need to run, post-install for now:


* add a resolv.conf line for google's 8.8.8.8 dns. This ensures that a public dns is used before a private one.
* ibus-setup

### Work

- hand-modify /etc/gdm3/custom.conf and set `WaylandEnable=true`.

## Setting up from a fresh Windows install

* run disk manager ("Create and format hard disk partitions") in the search
* shrink main volume by desired amount.
* [disable UEFI secure boot (arch linux boot will not start without it)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dual_boot_with_Windows#UEFI_Secure_Boot)
* start arch linux boot partition
* follow setting up arch instructions

## Setting up Arch

* after installation, you may need to enable and start up network devices:
  - `ip link dev eno1 up`
  - `systemctl enable dhcpcd`
  - `systemctl start dhcpcd`

wifi-menu can be used to connect to the network.

Then run:

- `bin/install_yay`
- `yay -S install insync`

## Testing

After installing ytlaces, the following should be validated:

* set password

## Troubleshooting

### CA certificates /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl expired

- remove existing certs `sudo rm -r /etc/puppetlabs/ssl`
- install puppetserver (in arch AUR)
- run `sudo puppetserver ca setup`

## cannot find "::ytlaces"

for some reason I had to sudo as root, then do the apply to find the module. some new version of puppet has issues?

This seemed to be fixed by symlinking `ytlaces` into the `/usr/share/puppet/modules` directory, or by fixing the name of the class in `./metadata.json` to `ytlaces` instead of `yt-laces`.

I verified the puppet module was successfully installed with `puppet modules list` as root (since you need to root to run this file).

## FAQ and Design Discussion

### Rolling my own installer

Previously, this config was mainly based on puppet. Puppet does provide a
facility for flexible, inheretible configuration units, which was really helpful
when I was running Arch, OSX, and Debian-based machines simultaneously.

However over time for one reason or another I converged on Ubuntu, and no longer
had the need for complex configuration. In addition, I couldn't express some
simpler concepts, like downloading files from random locations on the internet
without updating every single time, without the use of shell scripts. Once
things became as generally simple as installing packages from various places and
installing dotfiles (generally in $HOME/.config), it just became easier to
half-code/half-generate a hand rolled configuration installer.

### Why put binaries in $HOME instead of in /usr?

I like to put my binaries in $HOME, because:

- No need to run as root to reinstall the files.

### Prometheus and system monitoring

To help analyze performance issues as they arise, I run a prometheus instance
to collect metrics, as well as a [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to collect metrics on things like power.

General design:

- namespace ports 9100-9200 for prometheus-related things.

| port | purpose       |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 9100 | prometheus    |
| 9101 | node_exporter |
